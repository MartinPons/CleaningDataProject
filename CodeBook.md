## Gyroscope and accelerometer means and standar deviations dataset

The orginial data contains measures different measures from a gyroscope and accelerometer.

The data set presented in dataset.csv consists in a tidy data set with 180 records and 6o 8 columns extracted from

The original Data comes a project to predict human activity based on accelerometer and gyroscope signals from an smartphone.

The project monitored manually 30 subjects and six different kinds of activities as the gyroscope and the accelerometer were registrin different kinds of signals

The variables used in this data set are the means and standar deviations related measures for each subject and activity


### Variables in the data set

There are four types of variables

* Subject and Activity. Categorical variables

	Subject: labeled from 1 to 30
	Activity: one of Walking, Walking upstairs, Walking downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying

* Three Axial Raw signals: These include body acceleration and gravity acceleration signals

* Jerk signals: linear body linear acceleration and angular velocity derived in time

* Euclidean norm from Jerk signals

* Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) applied to some of the previous signals


The names of the variables are listed below
